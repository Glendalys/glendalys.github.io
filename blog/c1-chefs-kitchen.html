  <h1>DEVbootcamp Culture</h1>
  <h2>Interview to Phase 0</h2>
  <h4>December 21, 14</h4>

      When I first heard about DEVbootcamp, I thought how could someone learn development in 19-25weeks. I had never thought of myself as a developer but I started to investigate. It helped that I knew someone who worked for DBC. She informed my about the culture and the learning process and I thought ok maybe I can learn to code. I thought $12,000 to get a foundation in a couple of weeks that I use to get a position to create programs, pretty sweet deal. Coming from a visual arts background for over 10 years, creation is of high importance to my sense of self. I see coding as a new medium to create. After watching the Empathy video with my partner she said, “I think these are your people”. Personal growth is the foundation for my artistic practice, for my personal living practice. Community is of high value to me as well. I love that it seems to be of DBC as well. I am in phase 0 currently and thus far from the website to the interview process to this point I have felt that I am not alone. People have help me through challenges with +Google and GPS and I have to say I feel like we are all in this together and that is very special.

        My impression is that DBC is a software developers boot camp that places high importance on community learn, independent learning and drive, but also other skills that are needed in any business that is team oriented. Such as communication, self-awareness, emotional IQ and motivation.

        I have a couple of fears about the DBC. I have never coded in my life until preparing for the interview so I have some insecurities about how I can understand and keep up with my cohort. Also, how that would work in Peer Paring. But….I am very excited to be a member of this kind of learning environment. I am excited to learn and see my potential manifest. I am excited to meet people and interact with them and be apart of a community. And I have decided to be open to the material and the community, to be aware of how I feel and communicate that kindly and effectively and contribute as best I can.
