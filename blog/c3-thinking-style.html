      Anthony Gregorc came up with a test that tells you how you learn its called <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc Thinking Style</a>.  The test asks you to pick to words that describe you best. The first time I took the test it resulted in a tie between Abstract Sequential and Abstract Random. I thought ok at least I know I learn abstractly. I then took the test again and got Abstract Sequential and thought ok, “What does that mean?” I found this answer:
      </p>
      <p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <ul>• Looks forward and sees impact of actions taken now.</ul>
              <ul>• Explores all facets before deciding. Checks for accuracy.</ul>
              <ul>• Careful planner, systematic, enlivened by work.</ul>
              <ul>• Status quo buster, designer of change, inventive.</ul>
              <ul>• Systematic, logical, theoretical, self-sufficient.</ul>
              <ul>• Often not in the mainstream, persistent, thorough.</ul>
              <ul>• Intellectual, inquisitive, impartial, improvement oriented.</ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>
        So most of that seems true to me but not enough for me to be convinced. I had to take into account that I had tied. So I looked up Abstract Random just to compare and found:
      </p>
      <p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <ul>•"Just do it!", action oriented.</ul>
              <ul>• Quick-witted, charming, spontaneous.</ul>
              <ul>• Playful, injects fun into work.</ul>
              <ul>• Lives in the here and now, risk taker, creative.</ul>
              <ul>• Enjoys diversity, variety, competition.</ul>
              <ul>• Multi-tasker, cheerful, energetic, bold.</ul>
              <ul>• Quick thinking and acting, takes charge.</ul>
              <ul>• High visibility performer, accepts challenges.</ul>
              <ul>• Enjoys problem solving, negotiator.</ul>
              <ul>• Performs well under pressure, resilient.</ul>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </p>
      <p>I realized I am a combination so how do I use this to help me learn faster and most efficiently? Up until this week I was feeling very confident in my experience in Phase 0. The challenges using Ruby were difficult. The language and its logic are truly foreign to me and my understanding of it is going slower than I am used to when learning something new. Week 3 was the first week that I didn’t go in sequential order in the curriculum. It was a hard step at first to jump but soon realize it was the best action I could take given the quickly approaching due date. I’ve learned a few things about what I need this week that I will use in the future. One, I would rather work on a problem by myself for a while and use peer pairing when I am stuck or as a review session for myself. Two, I must limit my time on the challenges; if I am hitting a wall I will move on and come back to it later. Three, be easy on myself and ask for help when I need it. Four, remember that I am a visual learner and need images to aid my understanding of concepts. So I will seek out examples of the solutions to understand the overall logic. Five, make a drawing or 3d example that demonstrates the logic so that I can ‘SEE’ how it works. And at all cost make it FUN!</p>
