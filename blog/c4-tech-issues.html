      <p>I have researched some of the problems in the tech industry and what I have found is that women are one of them.
        Women contribute to just 1.2 percent of open source software and 5 percent of patents.
Women represent less than ten percent of venture capitalists.
In a McKinsey survey, 36 percent of men said they want to be CEO. Only 18 percent of women said the same.
Women hold only 14 percent of executive officer positions, the Catalyst Census reports.
Only 3 percent of tech startups are formed by women (Kauffman Foundation).
 <p>
  Why so few women in tech? Seven challenges and potential solutions.
</p>
<p>
  1. The amount of women graduating with computer science degrees has drastically decreased in the last three decades. One solution: Girls Who Code
</p>
<p>2. There aren’t enough visible mentors and role models for women who are interested in computer science. One solution: she++
    </p>
<p>
  3. Young girls are taught from a young age that engineering isn’t girly or meant for them. One solution: GoldieBlox.
  </p>
<p>4. There is a lot of pontification about including more women in tech, without much action. One solution: Passion Projects
  </p>
<p>5. Women aren’t encouraged to be tech entrepreneurs and can face extra institutional challenges. One solution: #40Forward
   </p>
<p>6. There isn’t a space specifically for women to learn code. One solution: Women’s Coding Collective
  </p>
<p>
  7. Minority women face not only a gender barrier, but also a racial barrier to getting a foot in the door in these fields. One solution: Black Girls Code
