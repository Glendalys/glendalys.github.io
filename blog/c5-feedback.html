      <p><h2>Pairing</h2>
        <h3>• What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</h3>
        I am a loner and introverted at heart so the idea of learning by pairing was originally freighting. Since starting to pair I have had the best experiences when roles are define and time blocking is put into place. I also find it very helpful to prepare a bit before the pairing and make sure I understand what the challenge is and what steps are need to fulfill the desired outcome. I also make an effort to set an intension before starting. For example, I want to drive and navigate for at least 30mins, making sure to check-in with my pair, ask questions if I’m not following, listen to my pairs needs and want and communicate mine.
      </p>

      <p><h3>•  Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</h3>During one pairing session I had I was able to help with concepts and the challenge more than usual because I had done it earlier in the week and set up that session as a review. It was nice to know something and help explain some concepts to someone.
      </p>
      <p><h3>•  Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h3>I find it difficult when someone know the material and powers through it doesn’t check in with me to make sure I understand. I especially find it frustrating when that same person when asked can’t explain to me what they are doing.  I feel that if you are doing something and you can’t explain it then maybe you shouldn’t be using it because you obviously don’t have a full understanding.</p>
      <p><h2>Feedback</h2>
      <h3>• How did you feel when you read your feedback?</h3>
      I am amazed that anyone thought I helped him or her technically. I generally feel like I get more technically then I give during parings.
      </p>
      <p><h3>•  Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</h3>
      The feedback for the most part confirm my thoughts on what areas I need improvement.
      </p>
      <p><h3>• Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</h3>
      I am going to time-box and drive more. I am also going to be more selective of who I pair with because I feel that some people are more suited for my style of learning.
      </p>
      <p><h3>•  How was it to write feedback? </h3>
      It was hard sometimes to give a person honest constructive feedback and still be kind. </p>

      <p><h3>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</h3>I think when it’s a good pairing I learn a lot about the material and when it’s a not so great pairing I learn a lot about how I learn, how to communicate and listen to my pair. So either the way I am learning something which is always good.
