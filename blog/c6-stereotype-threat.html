        Today I learned what stereotype threat means and realized I can now name something I have felt in my life more than I like to admit. I am a queer woman of color. I grew up in the Bronx and even though I have a graduate degree, speak two languages, and have won national awards I do know and have felt that I have not shown my full abilities under certain situations. I have already felt it at DBC and it does worry me at times.  I remember my first GPS. I was anxious the night before and felt very insecure. My heart was racing through it, I couldnâ€™t think and I thought I wish I could do this by myself.  I felt judged and underestimated.  Since then I have a routine that makes me feel more comfortable before engaging with the material and the community. I like to get myself into a state of confidence by singing a specific song and review the material before pairing with any one. I have also just time-boxed pairing to 1:30 and voice my thoughts more.
