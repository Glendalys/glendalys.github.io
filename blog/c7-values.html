      <h3>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose are important to you.</h3>
      <p>
      If I had to just pick one value that is of high importance to me it would spirituality. Seeing myself as a spiritual being and the world around me as full of other spiritual beings makes me feel connected to whomever I come in contact. I feel a part of a bigger whole and a great power in potential of contributing to that universal self.  It fills me up with love and compassion for others and life in general.  Knowing that everything that occurs happens for a reason and a purpose that serves everyone involved.  .
      </p>
      <h3>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?</h3>
      <p>
        When asked for advice I am usually asked for my perspective, to point out the opportunity of a given situation. The advice sought relates to my values on inner harmony, spirituality, compassion and close relationships. Sometimes when things are hard we lose our sight of the bigger picture not only for our own lives but also for the lives of our love ones and foes. I try to remember everyday that I am the creator of my reality and that my perspective on that reality creates my future reality. Our thoughts are powerful so I aim to use them to create the reality I would like see in the world.
      </p>
      <h3>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</h3>
      <p>I feel great when I think of my values, what I value and how I live my life to uphold those value to a high standard. The key to mediating any threat is to acknowledge it quickly and face it compassionate but firmly. I am a work in process and have my days of blurred focus. As long as I keep a community around me that reminds during those times I know I will be fantastic.
      </p>
      <h3>Can you think of any other exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</h3>
      <p>Whenever I am feeling down I stand up, move around, sing an inspiring song, or do a little dance. As Anthony Robins says ‘motion creates emotion’. They way we carry ourselves speaks loudly! So when I’m not feeling great the first thing I do is become aware of what I am doing with my body, my posture, and my facial expressions. From that awareness I can then decide how to move forward. </p>
