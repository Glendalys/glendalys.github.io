      <h3>Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</h3>
      <p>
      I was at a market and there were only 2 regular checkout lines and one 10 items of less line. I debated it and even though I had more than ten items and I went on the line anyway. A customer right behind me had one item and proceeded to count my items and joking say to the casher “Just 17 items, Lucky you!”
      I didn’t take it lightly and replied “There are 16 items …if you need this to go faster help pack my bags otherwise you can practice your counting while you wait.” He was stunned and I packed up my items and left in a heated state.
      </p>

      <h3>What was the source of the conflict?</h3>
      <p>
        I was already upset by the lack of registers opened on a weekend at a huge market. I was really upset with the situation the business had left it customers. They were under prepared. When I walk into to a business I want to feel welcomed, valued and cared for. I didn’t feel any of those.
      </p>

      <h3>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</h3>
      <p>I felt option less and that made me angry.
      </p>

      <h3>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</h3>
      <p>I didn’t really do anything to resolve the original conflict with the business itself.
      </p>

      <h3>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h3>
      <p>I would ask to speak to the manger and tell them I think it’s in their best interest to open up more registers if they have cashiers. If not I would have still gone on the 10 items or less line except I would have pointed out why I made that choice. </p>

      <h3>What did you learn from this experience?</h3>
      <p>When I don’t resolve a feeling it spills over into other situations, so I must be careful and listen to what is going on inside me and in the world. </p>
