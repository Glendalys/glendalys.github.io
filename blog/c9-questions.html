      Since beginning DBC my questions have gotten more specific. At first I remember feeling really overwhelmed by the whole experience and the material. I would go into office hours and just say help and explain to them what I was doing but I would often get the feedback “So what’s your question” and to be honest I didn’t know what answer would help me move forward. What has made them better is now before asking a question I figure out what the code is doing on each line and see where is my mix up then I type in on Google/office hours the specific question. Eight out of ten times I can find someone who has already had the problem answered.

        Good questions are specific, has example code that has the outcome you would like to achieve.  Start by summarizing your problem into an interesting and clear title. Explain how you encountered the problem you're trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself. The first paragraph in your question is the second thing most readers will see, so make it as engaging and informative as possible.
Not all questions benefit from including code. But if your problem is with code you've written, you should include some. But don't just copy in your entire program! Try to include a tag for the language, library, and specific API your question relates to.
Now that you're ready to ask your question, take a deep breath and read through it from start to finish. Pretend you're seeing it for the first time: does it make sense? Try reproducing the problem yourself, in a fresh environment and make sure you can do so using only the information included in your question. Add any details you missed and read through it again. Now is a good time to make sure that your title still describes the problem!
