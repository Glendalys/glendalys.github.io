    <h3>What is Version Control?</h3>
      <p>
      Simply put version control is a system that documents changes you make to a file or groups of files so that if you need to you can always go back to a specific version.Like backing up on Time Machine, if you use a Mac, you can always revert back to an earlier state. It’s great for collaborating on a project without hurting the development of the project. Many developers can be working on the same file at the same time with no worries.It’s helpful when you want to edit and experiment without hurting the framework.
      </p>


    <h3>What are Git and GitHub?</h3>
      <p>
      Git is a version control system (software) that you can download to your computer in which you can write code. You can think of it as a ‘tree’ where the ‘branches’ let you work your file without hurting the trunk. You bundle up all your changes in a thing called commit. Github is a social networking website where developers can share, edit, and add to projects they’re working on and to the projects of others.
      </p>

    <h3>What are the benefits of GitHub?</h3>
      <p>
      It makes it easy to collaborate and contribute to open source projects. Its help page is user friendly and a great source to find out how to fork a project (copy someone’s project to your profile so you can contribute), make changes, and send a pull request (notice telling the owner you have made some changes to their project for review). All this and the integrity of the project is kept in tack.  It’s a great place get feedback on a project you are stuck on or just want to share.
