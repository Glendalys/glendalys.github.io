      <h3>
      CSS positioning properties allow you to position an element. It can also place an element behind another, and specify what should happen when an element's content is too big. There are four types; static, relative, fixed and absolute.</h3>
    </p>

    <h3>Static</h3>
    <p>
      Is the default of the positioning. It looks at the page flow or the way the html is written and positons itself within that content in cascading order. Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
    </p>

    <h3>Relative</h3>
    <p>
      Allows you to move an element with out removing it from the natural flow of the page and push or pull it a bit without affecting the rest of the elements on the page. Relative positioned elements are affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
    </p>

    <h3>Absolute</h3>
    <p>
      Aligns element to its parent element. When you want an absolute position element to honor the position of its parent, the parent must have position relative. In other words an absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static. If no such element is found, the containing block is html. Absolutely positioned elements are removed from the normal flow and can overlap other elements.The document and other elements behave like the absolutely positioned element does not exist. Absolute positioned elements are affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
    </p>

  <h3>Fixed</h3>
    <p>
      An element with fixed position is positioned relative to the browser window. It will not move even if the window is scrolled hence fixed positioned elements are removed from the normal flow. The document and other elements behave like the fixed positioned element does not exist.Fixed positioned elements can overlap other elements.
